# NutriBench Dataset (Version 2)

This repository contains the cleaned version of the NutriBench dataset with duplicate meals removed.

## Data Structure

For each meal item in the dataset:
- `filtered_query`: Contains queries that met our checking criteria for accurate meal item + portion descriptions
- `revised_description`: Only appears when `filtered_query` is empty (no original queries passed criteria), containing manually rewritten meal descriptions

## Data Location

Clean, manually verified data is available in the `new_prompt_queries` folder:
1. `revised_metric/` - Contains metric measurement data
2. `revised_natural/` - Contains natural language measurement data
